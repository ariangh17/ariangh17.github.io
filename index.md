1. Lab 6
   Lab 6 was one of the most enjoyable labs we did in 120L, spending time learning how to make a variable like Ace have the value of 1 and 11 was quite the challenge but overall taught me a lot about how to attack my programming. This lab also had us integrate bool which is my favorite type.
3. Lab 12
   Lab 12 made my hall of fame list of labs because I have recently been doing research on making websites, clothing and have been producing music primarly hiphop for the past year. Making animated gifs and using sin and cos to map how my gif rotates was the most interesting thing Ive learned all year. I hope to utilize this skill on my own personal projects and was super excited to learn this topic.
5. Lab 2
   Last but not least was Lab 2, this lab taught me how to do the basics of mathematics in programming and is the foundation for a lot of the work we did in this class. While this lab was relatively simple, I did take the time to enjoy it and was one of the most memorable labs with my group member. This lab also had us utilize different commands to preform operations like additions, substraction, multiplcation and division.
